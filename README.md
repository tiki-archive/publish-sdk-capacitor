That's it. And yes, it's really that easy.

## Initialization

_Note: Before you get started, you will need a Publishing ID. It's free to create one; simply log in to our üßë‚Äçüíª [Developer Console](https://console.mytiki.com) and create a new Project._


```ts
import { instance } from '@mytiki/tiki-sdk-capacitor'

instance.initialize('<YOUR USER ID>', '<YOUR PUBLISHING ID>')
        .then((rsp) => console.log(`${rsp.address} initialized`))
```

_NOTE: Currently only iOS and Android are supported, not Web. If you'd like to use TIKI for web see our [JS SDK](https://github.com/tiki/tiki-sdk-js) or open a new Issue (it's easy to add)._
